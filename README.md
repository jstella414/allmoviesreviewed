created a filter that works, biggest issue that i was not able to delete the full movie card but only the title. might look into finishing this feature.
could not figure out how to get bootstrap modal to work. Sorry Jamal :/

# notes update

was able to get filter to work, realized the crud exercises had the answers i was looking for.
